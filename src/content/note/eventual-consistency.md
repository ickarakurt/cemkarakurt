description: An overview of eventual consistency in distributed systems.

Eventual Consistency is a compromise in distributed systems where data synchronization is relaxed but guaranteed to converge over time.

### Key Characteristics:

- Not all nodes have the same data immediately after a write
- Nodes will eventually sync and reach the same state
- Provides better availability compared to strong consistency
- Trades immediate accuracy for system responsiveness

### Technical Implementation:

- Uses background processes to reconcile data differences
- Typically employs techniques like:
  - Read repair
  - Anti-entropy processes
  - Gossip protocols

### When to Use:

High-traffic systems requiring continuous availability
Where slight data staleness is acceptable
Scenarios with frequent reads/writes
